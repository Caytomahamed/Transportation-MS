## Problem Statement

Our bus company is facing challenges with inefficient scheduling and routing, resulting in delays and poor customer service. This highlights the need for a bus transport management system that can improve scheduling and routing processes to provide better service to customers. By addressing this issue, the bus company can reduce delays, enhance efficiency, and improve the overall customer experience.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are to:

- **Improve scheduling efficiency:** Optimize bus schedules and routes to reduce travel time, minimize delays, and improve on-time performance.
- **Enhance customer service:** Provide real-time information on bus schedules and routes to passengers, allowing for effective journey planning and reducing wait times at bus stops.
- **Increase operational efficiency:** Automate tasks such as scheduling, route planning, and driver management, reducing time and resources needed for manual management.
- **Improve data management:** Collect and store data on bus schedules, routes, and passenger demand, enabling operators to analyze data for informed decision-making regarding service improvements.

## Methodology

The Agile methodology is suitable for this project, emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement. This iterative approach allows for flexibility in response to changing requirements or user feedback and encourages team collaboration, which is vital for a complex project like this.

## Requirements Specifications of the To-Be System

### Functional Requirements

The system should include significant functional requirements, including:

1. Login and Registration System
2. Booking Schedule
3. Schedule and Booking Management Section
4. Buses and Routing Management Section
5. Users Management Section
6. Logout Section

### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the properties or characteristics that the bus system must possess:

- **Performance:** The system must handle a large number of users, transactions, and requests, maintaining acceptable response times.
- **Reliability:** Ability to perform required functions under stated conditions for a specified period.
- **Security:** Degree of protection from harm for valuable assets, including user information.
- **Usability:** The system should be easy to use and navigate, accessible on various devices and platforms.
- **Maintainability:** The system must be easy to maintain and modify with minimal downtime, well-documented for developers and administrators.

## Existing System Description

The existing manual bus transport management system relies on paper-based processes and manual record-keeping, which is no longer effective for modern operations. This outdated system presents several challenges that hinder efficiency.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a Bus Transport Management System is a powerful software solution that can help bus transport companies improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the passenger experience. By providing a centralized platform for managing all aspects of the bus transport process, including:

- Scheduling
- Ticketing
- Fleet Management
- Driver Management
- Passenger Management
